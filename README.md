# Invariant Inference Framework:

This is the result of our implementation of the paper [An Invariant Inference Framework by
Active Learning and SVMs](../../Papers/AInvariantInferenceFrameworkbyActiveLearningandSVMs.pdf) by Li Jiaying.

For you to run the experiments on your own machine, please follow the steps below to set up your experiment environment.

## Work on Invariant Inference Framework
To build the framework currently is very easy,
there is not much dependencies you need to satisfy before build the whole project.

###Dependencies, for Windows/Linux/MacOSX Users:
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) version 2.8 or later.
* [libsvm](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) remember to put {libsvm}/bin folder into $PATH.
* [z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3) For Windows users, please put z3 to the folder
```
C:/Program Files
```
* [klee](https://klee.github.io/) This is optional currently.
* [Build tools](), such as make, Visual Studio 2015, or Xcode.


###Build InvariantInferenceFramework
```
git clone git@github.com:lijiaying/InvariantInferenceFramework.git
cd InvariantInferenceFramework
cd test
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -G [your platform]  // just use cmake .. if you are not sure
make
```

## Add your tests to this framework
#####As InvariantInferenceFramework is integrated with your examples, you need to do some modification on source code level before you can test your examples.
* READ carefully one example file in test folder before you write your own test.
* rewrite your loop code in a function with the name you like, my\_loop\_example for instance.
* modify function and function name as parameter for register\_target which is called by main function.
* rename your test file with the number of parameters and a "\_" as prefix. 
* modify the second line in CMakeLists.txt in the project folder as the numbers of parameter you need in your program.
* After the above step, you can make your project and then run the executable file.
