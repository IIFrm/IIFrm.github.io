This is the result of our implementation of the paper \href{../../Papers/AInvariantInferenceFrameworkbyActiveLearningandSVMs.pdf}{\tt An Invariant Inference Framework by Active Learning and S\+V\+Ms} by Li Jiaying.

For you to run the experiments on your own machine, please follow the steps below to set up your experiment environment.

\subsection*{Work on Invariant Inference Framework}

To build the framework currently is very easy, there is not much dependencies you need to satisfy before build the whole project.

\subsubsection*{Dependencies, for Windows/\+Linux/\+Mac\+O\+SX Users\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://cmake.org/}{\tt cmake} version 2.\+8 or later.
\item \href{https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/}{\tt libsvm} remember to put \{libsvm\}/bin folder into \$\+P\+A\+TH.
\item \href{https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3}{\tt z3} For Windows users, please put z3 to the folder 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 C:/Program Files
\end{DoxyCode}

\item \href{https://klee.github.io/}{\tt klee} This is optional currently.
\item \mbox{[}Build tools\mbox{]}(), such as make, Visual Studio 2015, or Xcode.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\#\#\#\+Build Invariant\+Inference\+Framework 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone git@github.com:lijiaying/InvariantInferenceFramework.git
2 cd InvariantInferenceFramework
3 cd test
4 mkdir build
5 cd build
6 cmake .. -G [your platform]  // just use cmake .. if you are not sure
7 make
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Add your tests to this framework}

\subparagraph*{As Invariant\+Inference\+Framework is integrated with your examples, you need to do some modification on source code level before you can test your examples.}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item R\+E\+AD carefully one example file in test folder before you write your own test.
\item rewrite your loop code in a function with the name you like, my\+\_\+loop\+\_\+example for instance.
\item modify function and function name as parameter for register\+\_\+target which is called by main function.
\item rename your test file with the number of parameters and a \char`\"{}\textbackslash{}\+\_\+\char`\"{} as prefix.
\item modify the second line in \hyperlink{CMakeLists_8txt}{C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} in the project folder as the numbers of parameter you need in your program.
\item After the above step, you can make your project and then run the executable file.
\end{DoxyItemize}
